- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gorvetco... My name is actually Cody Gorvett. Ive never had the opportunity before to learn from any schooling or particular teachings. So far Ive only learned the very little bit that Ive seached for myself, which have been very basic at that. So bear with me, and i appreciate any extra pointers or assistance offered.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... So Far, Because Im a new Chromebook user, Ive stumbled my way onto the Linux beta distribution thats can be enabled through Dev mode, and I havn't a clue what Im doing, but i have a strong interest to learn. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...Basic Basic stuff as of right now. For example, just yesterday I had just leaned how to cd my way around to get to a particular file I need. I still am having troubles though, I know home directory is /home/gorvetco but I still couldnt figure of for the life of me how to get to my chromebooks downloads folder (dont make fun :p lol) 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Any thing with anyone who would have the spare time and be willing to show me a thing or to.
- 📫 How to reach me ... My main Email is: Gorvetco@gmail.com | and my cell is: 519-550-4291. Shoot me a text or something sometime, Im pretty easy to get along with.

<!---  <~~~ I'm not sure what this part is for here lol Im assuming if I had a cool project I'd like to share, this would be the spot Id post it
